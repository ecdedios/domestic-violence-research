However, to date, few adolescent dating violence (ADV) prevention programs have been developed for and evaluated with youth exposed to IPV. An exception is Moms and Teens for Safe Dates (MTSD), an evidence-based ADV prevention program for mothers or maternal caregivers (mothers) exposed to IPV and their teenagers. The MTSD program comprises a series of booklets that families complete together in a home that includes activities to promote positive family communication and healthy teenager relationships. We developed a web-adapted version of the MTSD program&#x02014;entitled <em>eMoms and Teens for Safe Dates</em> (eMTSD)&#x02014;to provide a delivery format that may increase program appeal for digitally oriented teenagers, lower dissemination costs, lower reading burden for low-literacy participants, and incorporate built-in cues and reminders to boost program adherence.</p></div><div id="sec-a.m.b.u.b" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.m.b.u.btitle">Objective</h3><p class="p p-first-last">This protocol is for a research study that has the following three main objectives: to assess the acceptability of eMTSD; to identify the feasibility of the research process, including program adherence and participant recruitment and assessment; and to explore the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of 2 features&#x02014;text reminders and the creation of an <em>action plan</em> for engaging with the program&#x02014;that may increase program uptake and completion.</p></div><div id="sec-a.m.b.u.c" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.m.b.u.ctitle">Methods</h3><p class="p p-first-last">Approximately 100 mothers and their teenagers will be invited to complete eMTSD, which includes six 30-minute web-based modules over a 6-week period. Mothers will be recruited through community organizations and social media advertising and will be eligible to participate if they have at least 1 teenager aged 12 to 16 years living with them, have experienced IPV after the teenager was born, are not currently living with an abusive partner, and have access to an internet-enabled device. Using a factorial design, enrolled dyads will be randomized to the following four <em>adherence support</em> groups (n=25 dyads per group): text reminders and action planning, text reminders only, action planning only, and no adherence supports. All participants will complete brief web-based assessments at enrollment after each module is completed, after the full program is completed, and 90 days after enrollment.

Research suggests that IPV exposure, broadly defined as direct witnessing, hearing, or seeing the aftermath of any form (eg, physical or psychological) of violence between caregivers [<a href="#ref3" rid="ref3" class=" bibr popnode">3</a>], is a multifaceted traumatic experience that can have adverse impacts on children&#x02019;s cognitive (eg, biases in information processing), emotional (eg, anger dysregulation), and social development (eg, deviant peer affiliation) [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode">4</a>]. Children who experience these adverse impacts, in turn, are at increased risk of involvement in abusive dating and intimate partnerships during adolescence and adulthood [<a href="#ref5" rid="ref5" class=" bibr popnode">5</a>,<a href="#ref6" rid="ref6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>], a pattern referred to as the <em>intergenerational</em> transmission of IPV [<a href="#ref7" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode">7</a>].</p><p>The intergenerational transmission of IPV may be disrupted by programs that effectively work to interrupt the processes leading to adolescent dating violence (ADV) among youths exposed to IPV. However, although numerous studies have identified programs that prevent dating violence among general samples of youth, relatively little research has been conducted to develop or evaluate dating abuse prevention programs among high-risk youth, such as those who have been exposed to interparental IPV [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref8" class=" bibr popnode">8</a>]. Furthermore, despite research suggesting that parents and other caregivers play a key role in adolescent relationship development, scant research has been conducted to develop and evaluate family-based approaches to ADV prevention [<a href="#ref9" rid="ref9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>]. An exception is Moms and Teens for Safe Dates (MTSD), a family-based dating abuse prevention program developed for youth who have been exposed to IPV and their mothers or maternal caregivers (hereto forth referred to as <em>mothers</em> and inclusive of nonbinary people and gender expansive and transgender women who identify as mothers or maternal caregivers) who experienced the abuse [<a href="#ref10" rid="ref10" class=" bibr popnode">10</a>]. The MTSD program is designed to promote a family environment that is protective against dating abuse and comprises a set of 6 printed booklets with interactive activities that mothers and teenagers complete together (self-administer) in the home. In a randomized controlled trial, the program was found to be effective in increasing family cohesion and preventing dating abuse among youth with higher but not lower levels of IPV exposure [<a href="#ref11" rid="ref11" class=" bibr popnode">11</a>].</p><p>Given that the MTSD program was found to have positive impacts, the next step in the continuum of research on the program is to optimize the program for dissemination (ie, distribution of the program by the community and other agencies to mothers exposed to IPV and their teenagers) and implementation (ie, use of the program by mothers and their teenagers within the real-world family setting). Notably, the MTSD program was structured to avoid 2 main obstacles in the implementation of family-based interventions. First, it avoids logistical barriers that prevent families from attending programs offered at out-of-home locations as the program can be conducted at home (or at any location the family chooses). Second, there are no costs associated with training or paying the delivery staff as the program is self-administered. However, the drawbacks of the program from a dissemination and implementation (D&#x00026;I) standpoint include the costs of printing and mailing (eg, through the postal service) the booklets, which may be prohibitive to organizations serving mothers exposed to IPV, which are typically low-resourced community-based organizations [<a href="#ref12" rid="ref12" class=" bibr popnode">12</a>]; insufficient reach to low-literacy members of the target population, given the relatively high reading burden of the program; and a lack of built-in prompts or cues to engage with the program, which may result in poor user engagement in real-world settings. For example, in the MTSD randomized controlled trial, which provided small financial incentives for booklet completion, 62% of families reported completing the final booklet [<a href="#ref11" rid="ref11" class=" bibr popnode">11</a>].</p><p class="p p-last">The research team proposed that each of these D&#x00026;I barriers could be addressed by adapting the program for web-based delivery. In particular, web-based delivery has the potential to reduce dissemination costs; allow for the audiovisual presentation of information and activities, thus potentially reducing the reading burden and improving understanding among audiences with lower health literacy [<a href="#ref13" rid="ref13" class=" bibr popnode">13</a>,<a href="#ref14" rid="ref14" class=" bibr popnode">14</a>]; and allow for automated delivery of reminders, tailored based on website use, to maximize program uptake and completion. Furthermore, the research team postulated that a digital platform for MTSD may increase program appeal among teenager participants, given research suggesting that there has been a pronounced shift among US teenagers away from the use of <em>legacy</em> media (eg, books) and toward digital media [<a href="#ref15" rid="ref15" class=" bibr popnode">15</a>].</p></div><div id="sec-a.n.a.c" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.n.a.ctitle">Adapting the MTSD Program for Web-Based Delivery</h3><p class="p p-first-last">To develop a web-adapted version of the MTSD program, the research team followed a step-by-step process guided by the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share framework for developing effective digital interventions [<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16" class=" bibr popnode">16</a>]. Briefly, stages of the adaptation process included revision of the conceptual model, ideation of potential web-based representations of booklet material, iterative prototype development conducted in collaboration with a mother-teenager advisory board, 3 cycles of prototype user testing and refinement conducted with 6 mothers exposed to IPV and their teenagers, and a <em>soft launch</em> of the complete program and study procedures with a different set mother-teenager dyads (n=8) exposed to IPV. For the soft launch, mothers were provided with a link to the web-based program and asked to complete it with their teenagers over a 3-week implementation period. Feedback on design and functionality was obtained through surveys embedded in the website, a follow-up web-based survey, and a brief telephone exit interview. Informed by usability research with low-literacy parents, we prioritized the simplicity of design, content, and technical features during the first phases of prototype development [<a href="#ref17" rid="ref17" class=" bibr popnode">17</a>]. As part of this process, several text-based program activities were converted to multimedia instructions&#x02014;communications that use words in combination with graphics, animated videos, and other audiovisual experiences, which have been shown to improve understanding among low-literacy parents compared with the presentation of text alone [<a href="#ref18" rid="ref18" class=" bibr popnode">18</a>]. Mother and teenager feedback on the program was incorporated across all development phases, consistent with user-centered design principles [<a href="#ref19" rid="ref19" class=" bibr popnode">19</a>]. Specifically, feedback from mothers and teenagers was used to make decisions about the look and feel of the website; update the program to reflect current adolescent dating language and practices; represent a diverse set of mothers, teenagers, and relationships; and ensure that activities presenting teenager dating and family communication scenarios were realistic. The finalized program, which is titled <em>eMoms and Teens for Safe Dates</em> (eMTSD), comprises 6 30-minute modules that can be completed on any device with access to the internet (eg, smartphones, tablets, and computers).</p></div><div id="sec-a.n.a.d" class="sec sec-last"><h3 id="sec-a.n.a.dtitle">Objectives</h3><p class="p p-first-last">Here, we present a protocol for a feasibility and acceptability study of eMTSD, which is a necessary step in the continuum of research on this program.

Approximately 100 mother-teenager dyads, who may reside anywhere in the United States, will be enrolled in the study. Eligible mothers will have a teenager aged 12 to 16 years living in the home, have experienced IPV at some point after their teenager was born, and not be currently living with an abusive partner. Mother-teenager dyads who enroll will be randomized to 1 of 4 <em>adherence support</em> groups: text reminders only, action planning only, text reminders plus action planning, or no adherence support. Mothers in the text reminder groups will receive weekly SMS text messages tailored to their program completion level, which will cue them to engage with the program. Mothers in the action planning groups will complete a form before initiating the program, which will ask them to think about when and where they will work on the program with their teenagers. SMS text message reminders and action planning are referred to as <em>adherence support factors</em> as they are posited to increase the uptake and completion of program activities by mothers.</p><p class="p">All enrolled mother-teenager dyads, regardless of adherence support group assignment, will be asked to complete the eMTSD program together over a 6-week period with a 2-week grace period allowed for families who are unable to comply with this program completion schedule (ie, up to a maximum of 8 weeks will be allowed to complete the program). Feasibility and acceptability outcomes, described in more detail in the following sections, will be assessed in several ways. First, a study tracking database will allow us to calculate recruitment, enrollment, and retention rates. Second, website use data will allow us to assess program uptake, engagement, and adherence. Third, web-based surveys will be administered to mothers and teenagers at baseline (enrollment), after program completion (maximum of 8 weeks after baseline), and 90 days after baseline (follow-up). These surveys will assess program acceptability and provide information on the feasibility of using web-based surveys to collect data on healthy relationship cognition, skills, and behaviors. Finally, program acceptability will be assessed using brief (1-2 minutes) module acceptability surveys that appear in the web-based program at the end of each module. For each participant, the study is expected to last for approximately 90 days from enrollment to the follow-up assessment.</p></div><div id="sec-a.n.b.c" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.n.b.ctitle">Participants</h3><p class="p p-first-last">Eligible participants are mothers residing in the United States who (1) have at least 1 child aged 12 to 16 years (hereafter referred to as their <em>teenager</em>) who lives with them at least part of the time, (2) have experienced IPV at some point in their lives after at least 1 of their teenagers aged 12 to 16 years was born, (3) are not currently living with an abusive partner, (4) are able to read and speak English, (5) have access to an internet-enabled device, and (6) are able to receive SMS text messages.

Mothers with &#x0003e;1 age-eligible teenager will be further asked to select one teenager to participate in the study or, if they prefer, to allow study staff to randomly select the teenager who will participate. Mothers who indicate that they are interested in enrolling will be emailed links to a web-based consent form and parental permission form for them to complete, as well as an assent form for their teenager to complete. Once the consent and assent forms are completed, the study team will send the mother participant links to the baseline surveys via 2 emails (one email with the link for the mother baseline survey and another with the link to the teenager baseline survey). Mother-teenager dyads who complete the consent, assent forms and baseline surveys, all of which will be completed on the web, will be considered enrolled in the study and randomized to 1 of the following 4 <em>adherence support</em> groups: (1) action planning only, (2) SMS text message reminders only, (3) action planning and SMS text message reminders, or (4) no support. A computer random number generator will be used to select random permuted blocks with a block size of 8 and an equal allocation ratio. The random assignment table will be generated by the study principal investigator before the initiation of study enrollment. As participants are enrolled and records are added to the system by the study staff, dyads will be assigned a study ID, and the random assignment table will be consulted to assign the dyad to 1 of the 4 adherence support factor groups.</p></div><div id="sec-a.n.b.f" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.n.b.ftitle">The eMTSD Program: Program Structure and Conceptual Model</h3><p class="p p-first">The eMTSD program includes 6 modules, each designed to take approximately 30 minutes to complete, which delivers content adapted from the original MTSD program via text, videos, and interactive activities with questions for discussion between the mother and the teenager. Consistent with the original program, the modules aim to increase parent-teenager communication about healthy and unhealthy relationships and reduce teenagers&#x02019; risk of experiencing and perpetrating dating abuse. <a href="/pmc/articles/PMC9391968/figure/figure2/" target="figure" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="figure2" rid-ob="ob-figure2" co-legend-rid="lgnd_figure2"><span>Figure 2</span></a> provides a conceptual model, elaborated from the original MTSD conceptual model, which details the specific constructs that the program targets for changes within mothers, teenagers, and at the level of the family dyad, which, in turn, are posited to affect the teenager&#x02019;s risk of becoming involved in dating violence. As noted by Foshee et al [<a href="#ref10" rid="ref10" class=" bibr popnode">10</a>], protection motivation theory, cognitive developmental theories, and empirical research have been used to select and specify constructs that MTSD aims to change at the family and individual levels.</p><p class="p">Consistent with the format of the original program, the web-adapted program is designed such that the mothers and teenagers must complete the modules in order.

Mothers who log into the program are directed to watch a short animated <em>onboarding</em> explainer video that describes how the web-based program is organized. Once the onboarding video has been viewed mothers proceed to complete the <em>Getting Started</em> module, which is designed to prepare the mothers to engage in the program with their teenagers. At the end of the <em>Getting Started</em> module, mothers will be instructed to create a personal identification number for accessing any content in this module in the future and to start the program with their teenagers. To ensure that mothers are given the choice to discuss their IPV history with their teenagers, the <em>Getting Started</em> module, which is the only module that includes content addressing the mothers&#x02019; IPV history, becomes locked and not viewable to the teenagers after the mothers have completed it. Mothers will then proceed to the program home page, which includes a short video for mothers and teenagers to watch together and then complete 5 modules designed to be completed by mothers and their teenagers together. The five modules for mothers and teenagers to complete together include information and activities focused on (1) positive communication, (2) conflict resolution skills, (3) different forms of dating abuse and the harms they cause, (4) awareness of sexual dating abuse and the importance of consent, and (5) creating family rules and norms around dating relationships. <a href="/pmc/articles/PMC9391968/table/table1/" target="table" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="table1" rid-ob="ob-table1" co-legend-rid=""><span>Table 1</span></a> summarizes the module goals and sample activities, and <a href="#app1" rid="app1" class=" supplementary-material">Multimedia Appendix 1</a> provides screenshots of the activities selected from each module.</p></div><div id="sec-a.n.b.g" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.n.b.gtitle">Adherence Support Factors</h3><div id="sec-a.n.b.g.b" class="sec sec-first"><p></p><h4 id="sec-a.n.b.g.btitle" class="inline">Text Message Reminders </h4><p class="p p-first">A growing body of research suggests the potential of digital <em>triggers</em>, such as SMS text messages for fostering engagement in health interventions [<a href="#ref21" rid="ref21" class=" bibr popnode">21</a>].

Such a trial may be designed to examine program effects on ADV outcomes and the impacts of delivery mode (web-based vs booklet) and implementation support (eg, reminders and action planning) on D&#x00026;I outcomes.

The feasibility and acceptability study of the web-based version of this program will contribute to a small but growing body of research examining the use of technology and digital delivery methods for prevention programs that aim to make changes to the family environment and, in turn, prevent negative health outcomes among youth [<a href="#ref26" rid="ref26" class=" bibr popnode">26</a>,<a href="#ref30" rid="ref30" class=" bibr popnode">30</a>-<a href="#ref32" rid="ref32" class=" bibr popnode">32</a>].</p></div><div id="sec-a.n.d.d" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.n.d.dtitle">Strengths and Limitations</h3><p class="p p-first-last">The limitations of this study include the use of a convenience sample, which may preclude our ability to generalize findings to the population as a whole and explore differences in findings across subgroups (eg, youth of different gender identities and youth who have been exposed to different types of caregiver IPV). In addition, survey data rely on self-reporting and are, thus, potentially susceptible to social desirability response bias. The strengths of the study include the use of a multipronged recruitment strategy, which will allow us to explore the effectiveness of different recruitment sources and the testing of different implementation strategies (action planning and text reminders) that may increase program adherence.</p></div><div id="sec-a.n.d.e" class="sec sec-last"><h3 id="sec-a.n.d.etitle">Conclusions</h3><p class="p p-first-last">If eMTSD is acceptable and effective in preventing ADV, it is hoped that the program may be promoted by organizations serving survivors of IPV and their families. Given the dearth of programs designed specifically for youth exposed to IPV, eMTSD may address a critical gap in ADV prevention efforts and decrease the likelihood of abusive dating and intimate partnerships during adolescence and adulthood, as well as the adverse health and social impacts of ADV and IPV.</p></div></div><div id="ack-a.o.a" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="ack-a.o.atitle">Acknowledgments</h2><div class="sec"><p>The authors would like to thank the Connected Health for Applications and Interventions core team at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for their work in developing the web-based program, community-based organizations for helping with recruitment for this study, and the mothers and teenagers who will participate in this study.
