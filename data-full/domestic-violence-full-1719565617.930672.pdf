However, an estimated 12% of women with breast cancer simultaneously experience intimate partner violence (IPV; physical, psychological, or sexual abuse by an intimate partner). Women who experience IPV during breast cancer may lack traditional social support, and thus seek out alternative sources of support. Online community forums, such as Reddit, can provide accessible social connections within breast cancer&#x02013;specific communities. However, it is largely unknown how women with breast cancer use Reddit to describe and seek support for experiences of IPV.</p></div><div id="sec-a.f.b.t.b" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.f.b.t.btitle">Objective</h3><p class="p p-first-last">This study aims to explore how patients with breast cancer describe toxic relationships with their partners and immediate family members on Reddit.</p></div><div id="sec-a.f.b.t.c" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.f.b.t.ctitle">Methods</h3><p class="p p-first-last">This exploratory, cross-sectional, topic-modeling study analyzed textual data from 96 users in the r/breastcancer subreddit in February 2023. The meaning extraction method, inclusive of principal component analysis, was used to identify underlying components. Components were subjected to sentiment analysis and summative content analysis with emergent categorical development to articulate themes.</p></div><div id="sec-a.f.b.t.d" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.f.b.t.dtitle">Results</h3><p class="p p-first-last">Seven themes emerged related to toxic relationships: (1) contextualizing storytelling with lymph nodes, (2) toxic behavior and venting emotions, (3) abandonment and abuse following diagnosis, (4) toxic relationships and social-related fears, (5) inner strength and navigating breast cancer over time, (6) assessing social relationships and interactions, and (7) community advice and support. Toxic relationships were commonly characterized by isolation, abandonment, and emotional abuse, which had profound emotional consequences for patients. Reddit facilitated anonymous venting about toxic relationships that helped patients cope with intense feelings and stress. Exchanging advice and support about navigating toxic relationships during breast cancer were core functions of the r/breastcancer community.</p></div><div id="sec-a.f.b.t.e" class="sec sec-last"><h3 id="sec-a.f.b.t.etitle">Conclusions</h3><p class="p p-first-last">Findings emphasized the value of Reddit as a source of social support for patients with breast cancer experiencing toxic relationships. Clinicians who understand that many patients with breast cancer experience toxic relationships and considerable psychological sequelae are better prepared to support their patients&#x02019; holistic well-being. Further investigation of Reddit as a possible resource for advice, information, and support has the potential to help inform clinical practice and subsequently, patient health outcomes.</p></div></div><div class="sec"><strong class="kwd-title">Keywords: </strong><span class="kwd-text">breast cancer, intimate partner violence, meaning extraction method, Reddit, sentiment analysis, social media, social support, toxic relationships, topic modelling</span></div></div><div id="sec-a.g.a" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="sec-a.g.atitle">Introduction</h2><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Breast cancer has a way of making existing cracks in relationships even wider. Just like water will fill a crack in the road, freeze, and create a larger gap, breast cancer tends to permeate all parts of our lives and distance us from people with whom we have troubled relationships.</p><div class="half_rhythm align_right attrib">Original poster #85</div></blockquote><p class="p p-first">Projected rates of breast cancer in Canada have remained consistent over the past 5 years, with estimates that approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and breast cancer will account for 25% of all new cancer cases [<a href="#ref1" rid="ref1" class=" bibr popnode">1</a>-<a href="#ref3" rid="ref3" class=" bibr popnode">3</a>]. Women&#x02019;s experiences of breast cancer are influenced by the social determinants of health, particularly their social environment [<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode">4</a>,<a href="#ref5" rid="ref5" class=" bibr popnode">5</a>]. Among patients with breast cancer, strong social relationships have been found to act as a buffer to stress [<a href="#ref6" rid="ref6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>] and help to improve treatment effectiveness, psychological functioning, coping, survival, and quality of life, as well as prevent cancer recurrence [<a href="#ref7" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode">7</a>-<a href="#ref9" rid="ref9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>]. Conversely, weak or nonexistent social relationships have been broadly linked to long-term psychological distress [<a href="#ref10" rid="ref10" class=" bibr popnode">10</a>] and an increased risk of breast cancer progression, recurrence, and mortality [<a href="#ref11" rid="ref11" class=" bibr popnode">11</a>,<a href="#ref12" rid="ref12" class=" bibr popnode">12</a>]. However, there is a need for research that explores connections between social relationships and breast cancer outcomes among diverse populations and social contexts.</p><p>Intimate partners (eg, spouses and significant others) and immediate family members (eg, parents and siblings) are perceived as the most important social supports for patients with breast cancer [<a href="#ref13" rid="ref13" class=" bibr popnode">13</a>,<a href="#ref14" rid="ref14" class=" bibr popnode">14</a>], as they provide essential social-emotional, tangible, affection, and positive social interaction support [<a href="#ref15" rid="ref15" class=" bibr popnode">15</a>]. For example, partners commonly serve as the primary caregivers of patients with cancer [<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16" class=" bibr popnode">16</a>]. However, not all social relationships are supportive [<a href="#ref17" rid="ref17" class=" bibr popnode">17</a>]. Patients who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) may face a lack of support due to the abusive behaviors of their partner [<a href="#ref18" rid="ref18" class=" bibr popnode">18</a>]. IPV, understood as physical, psychological, or sexual abuse within the context of coercive control by an intimate partner [<a href="#ref19" rid="ref19" class=" bibr popnode">19</a>], concurrently affects an estimated 12.5% of patients with breast cancer [<a href="#ref20" rid="ref20" class=" bibr popnode">20</a>]&#x02014;and this is likely to be an underestimation given underreporting of IPV [<a href="#ref21" rid="ref21" class=" bibr popnode">21</a>]. Similarly, patients may be negatively affected by an unsupportive (but not necessarily abusive) partner [<a href="#ref22" rid="ref22" class=" bibr popnode">22</a>], as well as abusive or unsupportive family members [<a href="#ref23" rid="ref23" class=" bibr popnode">23</a>,<a href="#ref24" rid="ref24" class=" bibr popnode">24</a>]. Aside from the patients themselves, immediate female family members are often most affected by a breast cancer diagnosis; unsupportive reactions often include being in denial about the diagnosis and abandoning the patient [<a href="#ref25" rid="ref25" class=" bibr popnode">25</a>].</p><p>Toxic relationships are characterized by conflict, competition, undermining, disrespect, and a lack of cohesiveness [<a href="#ref26" rid="ref26" class=" bibr popnode">26</a>]. Toxic relationships encompass unsupportive and abusive dynamics in both romantic (eg, a partner) and platonic (eg, a family member) contexts and are associated with emotional distress [<a href="#ref26" rid="ref26" class=" bibr popnode">26</a>], which imparts numerous downstream mental and physical health consequences [<a href="#ref27" rid="ref27" class=" bibr popnode">27</a>]. To compensate for unmet support needs, patients with breast cancer may expand their social networks via the internet, including social media [<a href="#ref28" rid="ref28" class=" bibr popnode">28</a>]. Online forums are a popular means of accessing information and support related to breast cancer awareness, literacy, and treatment [<a href="#ref29" rid="ref29" class=" bibr popnode">29</a>-<a href="#ref33" rid="ref33" class=" bibr popnode">33</a>]. The use of online breast cancer forums grew exponentially between 2006 and 2010, growing from an estimated 282,000 new posts per year to over 1,270,000 new posts per year [<a href="#ref34" rid="ref34" class=" bibr popnode">34</a>] and continues to increase over a decade later [<a href="#ref35" rid="ref35" class=" bibr popnode">35</a>,<a href="#ref36" rid="ref36" class=" bibr popnode">36</a>]. Despite data availability and the potential for knowledge advancement [<a href="#ref33" rid="ref33" class=" bibr popnode">33</a>], research on patient social media use, particularly in the context of toxic relationships, is underexplored.</p><p class="p p-last">Reddit, the world&#x02019;s third most popular social media platform, is an online forum dedicated to community-building, news dissemination, and discussion facilitation [<a href="#ref37" rid="ref37" class=" bibr popnode">37</a>]. The Reddit platform consists of topic-specific subreddits (ie, forums), where all content is user-generated. Users subscribe to subreddits that interest them to see more related content. Users can post content, as well as comment and vote on others&#x02019; content. To join Reddit, users create a username and password&#x02014;no identifiable information is required. Reddit&#x02019;s capacity for anonymous participation and long-form, conversational content makes the platform a rich source of self-reported textual data [<a href="#ref38" rid="ref38" class=" bibr popnode">38</a>]. The Reddit platform includes breast cancer&#x02013;specific spaces that offer access to psychosocial support (eg, r/breastcancer), presenting a unique and valuable opportunity to explore how patients with breast cancer navigate toxic relationships after diagnosis. Previous research has provided preliminary insights into how patients with breast cancer use Reddit [<a href="#ref39" rid="ref39" class=" bibr popnode">39</a>], but there is a notable gap in the literature regarding how patients with breast cancer describe toxic relationships and their psychosocial impacts on Reddit. Studying social media data has the potential to generate significant advances in knowledge [<a href="#ref33" rid="ref33" class=" bibr popnode">33</a>], which can inform improvements to psychosocial support for patients with breast cancer experiencing toxic relationships and enhance care providers&#x02019; ability to promote patient well-being.

As of February 2023, the public r/breastcancer subreddit, established in 2011, included 13,900 subscribers and self-identified as a support and information group for people who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and their caregivers and loved ones. While Reddit generally attracts young White men of high socioeconomic status [<a href="#ref38" rid="ref38" class=" bibr popnode">38</a>], demographics vary by subreddit and r/breastcancer is hypothesized to be largely composed of women [<a href="#ref40" rid="ref40" class=" bibr popnode">40</a>].</p></div><div id="sec-a.g.b.c" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.g.b.ctitle">Ethical Considerations</h3><p class="p p-first-last">This study was deemed exempt from oversight by the author&#x02019;s institutional ethics review board because all data were gathered from the public domain (per Article 2.2 of the Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans).

Key content words included <em>money</em>, <em>quit</em>, and <em>follow</em>. The subreddit facilitated advice regarding various topics, especially related to navigating financial matters and treatment options in the context of a toxic relationship.</p><p>Numerous users offered money-related advice to OPs facing difficult financial situations because of toxic relationships. Situations included financial coercion, exploitation, and manipulation following cancer disclosure and managing finances during separation from a toxic partner. For instance, one OP was abandoned by their partner during a joint real estate purchase. A community member with self-professed real estate expertise strongly advised the OP against continuing with the investment, writing, &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m begging you... please do NOT sign anything else! Lose your money... that&#x02019;s not important... please do not continue with this purchase&#x0201d; (OP 89).</p><p>Members also counseled OPs about postmastectomy reconstruction by offering advice on how to reduce social pressure and prioritize personal preferences. For example, one OP shared how they resisted their partner&#x02019;s pressure to follow reconstruction, stating, &#x0201c;I made him look at photos of reconstruction to show him that it&#x02019;s not a free boob job and can be ugly. He changed his tune real quick&#x0201d; (OP 39).</p><p>Members who were ultimately pressured into reconstruction strongly encouraged OPs to follow their instincts. For example, one member who was coerced into reconstruction by their husband advised, &#x0201c;I constantly wish I went flat instead. If I had to do it again I would listen to my gut and go flat&#x0201d; (OP 8).</p><p>Similarly, it was common to share advice about treatment adherence. Many OPs struggling with a lack of support expressed wanting to quit treatment. While members empathized with users and understood their feelings, they ultimately encouraged continuing. For example, one OP shared, &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m just sick of this. I&#x02019;m pretty sure I&#x02019;m done with it all&#x0201d; (OP 34).</p><p class="p p-last">The community offered empathy, such as, &#x0201c;When I was in the middle of your treatment, I was frustrated too and tried to quit every week&#x0201d; (OP 7), as well as advice, for example, &#x0201c;Don&#x02019;t stop treatment without a good reason. It&#x02019;s a gift in spite of tough side effects because it keeps us alive&#x0201d; (OP 48).</p></div></div><div id="sec-a.g.d" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="sec-a.g.dtitle">Discussion</h2><div id="sec-a.g.d.b" class="sec sec-first"><h3 id="sec-a.g.d.btitle">Principal Results</h3><p class="p p-first-last">This study explored the use of the r/breastcancer subreddit by patients to describe toxic relationships with their partners and immediate family members. Themes highlighted patients&#x02019; lived experiences of toxic relationships, emotional impacts, and support from the subreddit community. A key finding was that many people with breast cancer sought out the r/breastcancer subreddit to share their experiences of toxic relationships, often including descriptions of abandonment, isolation, and emotional abuse within this context. Further, this study presented compelling evidence that toxic relationships impart profound emotional consequences for patients and that some patients cope with these strong emotions through online venting. This work also emphasized the value of online communities like Reddit as alternative, complementary sources of support for patients experiencing toxic relationships.</p></div><div id="sec-a.g.d.c" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.g.d.ctitle">Comparison With Prior Work</h3><div id="sec-a.g.d.c.b" class="sec sec-first"><p></p><h4 id="sec-a.g.d.c.btitle" class="inline">Abandonment and Betrayal as Common Experiences </h4><p class="p p-first">These findings suggest that abandonment is a common experience for patients with breast cancer following diagnosis. Prior research has lacked consensus regarding the risk of abandonment among patients with breast cancer after diagnosis [<a href="#ref55" rid="ref55" class=" bibr popnode">55</a>,<a href="#ref56" rid="ref56" class=" bibr popnode">56</a>]. Generally, however, women are more likely to be abandoned by a partner after being diagnosed with a serious medical illness [<a href="#ref57" rid="ref57" class=" bibr popnode">57</a>]. Further, distancing is the most prevalent unsupportive response experienced by a patient following their breast cancer diagnosis [<a href="#ref23" rid="ref23" class=" bibr popnode">23</a>]. Fears and feelings of abandonment following diagnosis are also well-documented within breast cancer research [<a href="#ref58" rid="ref58" class=" bibr popnode">58</a>-<a href="#ref60" rid="ref60" class=" bibr popnode">60</a>]. Given this understanding, and considering that Reddit data can be regarded as an authentic representation of user experiences [<a href="#ref61" rid="ref61" class=" bibr popnode">61</a>], it is reasonable to conclude that these findings are suggestive of an increased risk of abandonment for patients with breast cancer.</p><p class="p p-last">A novel finding was the occurrence of emotional whiplash, where a patient was initially promised support by their partner but was later abandoned unexpectedly. The emotional transition from security to betrayal was repeatedly reported as devastating. There is limited research describing betrayal in the context of abandonment and breast cancer, but it is known that feelings of betrayal in this context can reduce the desire for future relationships [<a href="#ref62" rid="ref62" class=" bibr popnode">62</a>]. Broadly, the loss, disruption, and deterioration of social ties are some of the most stressful experiences a patient with cancer can face [<a href="#ref6" rid="ref6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>], which makes abandonment a serious risk factor for reduced mental health [<a href="#ref63" rid="ref63" class=" bibr popnode">63</a>]. Comprehensive cancer care entails stress-reducing psychosocial interventions [<a href="#ref63" rid="ref63" class=" bibr popnode">63</a>], but a limited understanding of the psychological effects of betrayal hinders clinicians&#x02019; ability to optimally manage abandonment-related stress.</p></div><div id="sec-a.g.d.c.c" class="sec"><p></p><h4 id="sec-a.g.d.c.ctitle" class="inline">Anonymous Venting Enables Disclosure of Toxic Relationships </h4><p class="p p-first">The central role of venting within the r/breastcancer community highlighted the unique socioemotional needs of patients with breast cancer in the context of toxic relationships. Toxic relationships impart emotional consequences that can be difficult to navigate and cope with [<a href="#ref26" rid="ref26" class=" bibr popnode">26</a>]. Venting is a disinhibitory, emotion-focused strategy for coping with stress [<a href="#ref64" rid="ref64" class=" bibr popnode">64</a>,<a href="#ref65" rid="ref65" class=" bibr popnode">65</a>]. Venting can be considered a form of expressive writing, that is, writing that describes a deeply personal experience [<a href="#ref66" rid="ref66" class=" bibr popnode">66</a>], which is well-evidenced to facilitate coping with psychological distress [<a href="#ref67" rid="ref67" class=" bibr popnode">67</a>]. Online venting was consistently described as cathartic among patients in this study, aligning with prior evidence of patients with breast cancer seeking support in online communities during periods of stress [<a href="#ref68" rid="ref68" class=" bibr popnode">68</a>] and perceiving reduced stress after they vent online [<a href="#ref69" rid="ref69" class=" bibr popnode">69</a>]. Further, patients with breast cancer who self-manage their emotions by narrating their experiences are known to experience strong psychological benefits [<a href="#ref70" rid="ref70" class=" bibr popnode">70</a>].</p><p class="p p-last">It might be expected that the stigma attached to breast cancer and toxic relationships would hinder disclosure [<a href="#ref58" rid="ref58" class=" bibr popnode">58</a>,<a href="#ref71" rid="ref71" class=" bibr popnode">71</a>], however, seeking out group-oriented support is reportedly most common for diseases considered stigmatizing [<a href="#ref72" rid="ref72" class=" bibr popnode">72</a>]. The latter position is consistent with this study, as venting posts often included stigmatized thoughts and feelings (eg, wanting to &#x02018;give in&#x02019; to cancer or discussing abuse without wanting to leave the relationship). Further, it appeared that Reddit&#x02019;s capacity for anonymity created a sense of safety that made patients comfortable disclosing information considered stigmatizing, which is consistent with existing evidence [<a href="#ref73" rid="ref73" class=" bibr popnode">73</a>]. Overall, patients appeared to perceive anonymous venting via Reddit as an effective, safe strategy for coping with stress from toxic relationships. Interventions that aim to promote coping among this patient population would likely benefit from integrating anonymity to encourage uninhibited self-expression.</p></div><div id="sec-a.g.d.c.d" class="sec sec-last"><p></p><h4 id="sec-a.g.d.c.dtitle" class="inline">Advice About Navigating Toxic Relationships </h4><p class="p p-first">Validating the feelings of other users, as well as soliciting and providing advice regarding toxic relationships, were core activities within r/breastcancer. It was previously known that participation in online forums contributes to the practical, informative, and emotional empowerment of patients with breast cancer [<a href="#ref74" rid="ref74" class=" bibr popnode">74</a>]. However, this study uniquely identified that community members on Reddit often urged OPs to leave or go against the wishes of their abusive partner. While well-intentioned, this advice may not always be safe or practical. Leaving an abusive partner can be the most dangerous time in the relationship due to an increased risk of retaliation [<a href="#ref75" rid="ref75" class=" bibr popnode">75</a>]. Similarly, acting in a manner that might antagonize an abuser can initiate or escalate relationship discord and consequently increase the risk of violence [<a href="#ref76" rid="ref76" class=" bibr popnode">76</a>]. Furthermore, patients who depend on an abusive partner (eg, for caregiving, access to health insurance, and transportation to appointments [<a href="#ref77" rid="ref77" class=" bibr popnode">77</a>]) may be unable to leave or risk the relationship by acting defiantly [<a href="#ref78" rid="ref78" class=" bibr popnode">78</a>]. Resultantly, relationship advice received on Reddit by patients with abusive partners may have been incompatible with their reality or suboptimal in promoting their safety.</p><p class="p p-last">This indicates a knowledge gap concerning safety planning within r/breastcancer; safety planning can be understood as the development of strategies to reduce the risk of abuse and enhance support [<a href="#ref79" rid="ref79" class=" bibr popnode">79</a>]. Safety planning is a proven, widely endorsed health promotion intervention that is effective both within an abusive relationship and after leaving [<a href="#ref80" rid="ref80" class=" bibr popnode">80</a>,<a href="#ref81" rid="ref81" class=" bibr popnode">81</a>]. Considering the prevalence of abuse among patients with breast cancer [<a href="#ref20" rid="ref20" class=" bibr popnode">20</a>] and that many seek support in online forums such as Reddit [<a href="#ref39" rid="ref39" class=" bibr popnode">39</a>], it could be useful to raise awareness of safety planning within r/breastcancer as a health promotion strategy. Further, considering the importance attributed to inner strength by patients in this study, building awareness of strengths-based approaches to safety planning [<a href="#ref82" rid="ref82" class=" bibr popnode">82</a>] could be particularly useful. For example, community moderators could pin relationship-related resources (eg, hotlines and informative websites) as the top comment under posts about challenging, potentially toxic relationships. However, a needs assessment would be best suited to developing an IPV-related intervention considered acceptable and effective within r/breastcancer.</p></div></div><div id="sec-a.g.d.d" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.g.d.dtitle">Clinical Implications</h3><p class="p p-first">Psycho-oncology care teams play a critical role in optimizing health outcomes for patients with breast cancer, yet the emotional well-being of patients with cancer is often underreported and underexplored [<a href="#ref83" rid="ref83" class=" bibr popnode">83</a>]. Patient-reported social media data offers real-time insights into patient experiences and needs which can be beneficial for informing clinical practice [<a href="#ref33" rid="ref33" class=" bibr popnode">33</a>,<a href="#ref83" rid="ref83" class=" bibr popnode">83</a>].</p><p>Clinicians who understand that many of their patients with breast cancer are negatively affected by toxic relationships are better prepared to support their emotional well-being.

Recommending Reddit as a possible source of advice, information, and support could be a valuable addition to clinical practice for patients navigating breast cancer and toxic relationships. However, because digital literacy is often overlooked in breast cancer care [<a href="#ref85" rid="ref85" class=" bibr popnode">85</a>], clinicians who concurrently promote digital literacy can empower their patients to access online communities and ultimately, improve their health outcomes.</p></div><div id="sec-a.g.d.e" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.g.d.etitle">Limitations</h3><p class="p p-first-last">There are limitations to this work. First, the analysis was conducted by a single researcher, which may have introduced bias in data interpretation. The analysis also relied heavily on automated methods that may have been inadequate in fully capturing nuance or interpreting context cues in textual data. Second, these data are self-reported, which may have resulted in biased perspectives. While users in this sample self-identified as patients with breast cancer, it was not possible to validate this. These data may have inadvertently included content from online robots or people without breast cancer, and thus may not accurately reflect the experiences of the target population. Additionally, these data were scraped from a single social media platform and may not be representative of the experiences of patients who use other social media platforms, do not use Reddit to discuss their personal lives, or lack access to an internet-enabled device. No demographic information was available to further contextualize findings. It is important to note that these results only relate to experiences of emotional abuse, as physical and sexual abuse were not represented in the data. Furthermore, all participants could write in English, were digitally literate, and had access to the internet, meaning that the findings may not represent the experiences of patients who are nonanglophone or lack technological access or literacy. Caution should be used when applying these findings to other patients with breast cancer.</p></div><div id="sec-a.g.d.f" class="sec sec-last"><h3 id="sec-a.g.d.ftitle">Conclusions</h3><p class="p p-first-last">This study identified that toxic relationships described by patients with breast cancer on Reddit were common and characterized by abandonment, abuse, and unsupportive behaviors. Patients often experienced profound emotional reactions to this form of social stress and anonymous venting on Reddit was described as an effective coping mechanism. Some patients described breast cancer and toxic relationships as adverse experiences that ultimately enhanced their inner strength. Overall, the r/breastcancer community appeared to be a means of exchanging advice, information, and support for patients experiencing toxic relationships. Clinicians who understand that their patients may be negatively affected by toxic relationships are better prepared to support their holistic well-being. Further investigation of Reddit as a possible source of advice, information, and support has the potential to help inform clinical practice and subsequently, improve patient health outcomes.</p></div></div><div id="glossary-a.h.b" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="glossary-a.h.btitle">Abbreviations</h2><div class="bk-sec"><div><table class="default-table glossary"><tbody><tr><td id="abb1">IPV</td><td>intimate partner violence</td></tr><tr><td id="abb2">MEM</td><td>meaning extraction method</td></tr><tr><td id="abb3">OP</td><td>original poster</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><div id="notes-a.h.c" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="notes-a.h.ctitle">Notes</h2><div id="sec-a.h.c.a" class="sec sec-first"><h2 id="sec-a.h.c.atitle">Data Availability</h2><p class="p p-first-last">The data sets generated or analyzed during this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></div></div><div id="fn-group-a.h.a" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="fn-group-a.h.atitle">Footnotes</h2><!--back/fn-group--><div class="fm-sec half_rhythm small"><div>Contributed by <p class="p p-first-last">Authors' Contributions: CAD was involved in the conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, and both original draft preparation and review and editing of the manuscript.
