Yet little is known about people&#x02019;s early engagement with eHealth trials, from recruitment to preintervention autoregistration processes. A recent randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of an eHealth safety decision aid for New Zealand women in the general population who experienced intimate partner violence (isafe) provided the opportunity to examine recruitment and preintervention participant engagement with a fully automated Web-based registration process. The trial aimed to recruit 340 women within 24 months.</p></div><div id="sec-a.l.b.w.b" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.l.b.w.btitle">Objective</h3><p class="p p-first-last">The objective of our study was to examine participant preintervention engagement and recruitment efficiency for the isafe trial, and to analyze dropout through the registration pathway, from recruitment to eligibility screening and consent, to completion of baseline measures.</p></div><div id="sec-a.l.b.w.c" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.l.b.w.ctitle">Methods</h3><p class="p p-first-last">In this case study, data collection sources included the trial recruitment log, Google Analytics reports, registration and program metadata, and costs. Analysis included a qualitative narrative of the recruitment experience and descriptive statistics of preintervention participant engagement and dropout rates. A Koyck model investigated the relationship between Web-based online marketing website advertisements (ads) and participant accrual.</p></div><div id="sec-a.l.b.w.d" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.l.b.w.dtitle">Results</h3><p class="p p-first-last">The isafe trial was launched on September 17, 2012. Placement of ads in an online classified advertising platform increased the average number of recruited participants per month from 2 to 25. Over the 23-month recruitment period, the registration website recorded 4176 unique visitors. Among 1003 women meeting eligibility criteria, 51.55% (517) consented to participate; among the 501 women who enrolled (consented, validated, and randomized), 412 (82.2%) were accrued (completed baseline assessments). The majority (n=52, 58%) of the 89 women who dropped out between enrollment and accrual never logged in to the allocated isafe website. Of every 4 accrued women, 3 (314/412, 76.2%) identified the classified ad as their referral source, followed by friends and family (52/412, 12.6%). Women recruited through a friend or relative were more likely to self-identify as indigenous M&#x00101;ori and live in the highest-deprivation areas. Ads increased the accrual rate by a factor of 74 (95% CI 49&#x02013;112).</p></div><div id="sec-a.l.b.w.e" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.l.b.w.etitle">Conclusions</h3><p class="p p-first-last">Print advertisements, website links, and networking were costly and inefficient methods for recruiting participants to a Web-based eHealth trial.

It is estimated that one in every three women experiences physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner [<a href="#ref1" rid="ref1" class=" bibr popnode">1</a>]. The negative impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) on the health and well-being of women and their children has been documented for over two decades [<a href="#ref1" rid="ref1" class=" bibr popnode">1</a>,<a href="#ref2" rid="ref2" class=" bibr popnode">2</a>]. While primary prevention efforts are required to reduce the prevalence of this human rights violation [<a href="#ref3" rid="ref3" class=" bibr popnode">3</a>,<a href="#ref4" rid="ref4" class=" bibr popnode">4</a>], it is also necessary to provide evidence-based essential services that promote the safety and well-being of those experiencing abuse [<a href="#ref5" rid="ref5" class=" bibr popnode">5</a>]. However, women&#x02019;s ability to access services is often constrained by the ongoing pattern of coercive and controlling behaviors that isolate a woman from both informal and formal support systems [<a href="#ref6" rid="ref6" class=" bibr popnode">6</a>,<a href="#ref7" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode">7</a>].</p><p class="p">Recognizing the growing number of people who turn to the Internet to seek help [<a href="#ref8" rid="ref8" class=" bibr popnode">8</a>,<a href="#ref9" rid="ref9" class=" bibr popnode">9</a>], eHealth interventions have the potential to provide an accessible, safe, cost effective resource for women experiencing violence. eHealth interventions can provide a pathway for women to access health, justice, and civil society essential services. Innovative, interactive eHealth interventions for women who experience abuse are being developed and tested internationally [<a href="#ref10" rid="ref10" class=" bibr popnode">10</a>-<a href="#ref14" rid="ref14" class=" bibr popnode">14</a>]. In developing this evidence base, it is critical to examine the processes of recruiting women who are experiencing abuse for Web-based trials. In this study we examined the recruitment experience for the New Zealand isafe trial [<a href="#ref15" rid="ref15" class=" bibr popnode">15</a>] that tested a Web-based safety decision aid for women who experience abuse.</p><div id="sec-a.m.a.d" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.m.a.dtitle">Help Seeking Among Women Who Experience Abuse</h3><p class="p p-first-last">Qualitative research findings document that women implement a range of both active and passive strategies to keep themselves and their children safe from a partner&#x02019;s coercive controlling behaviors [<a href="#ref16" rid="ref16" class=" bibr popnode">16</a>-<a href="#ref18" rid="ref18" class=" bibr popnode">18</a>]. They often tell friends, family, or coworkers (informal networks) about the abuse they are experiencing. These informal sources of support, however, often lack the understanding and skill to provide helpful responses [<a href="#ref7" rid="ref7" class=" bibr popnode">7</a>,<a href="#ref19" rid="ref19" class=" bibr popnode">19</a>]. Compared with disclosing abuse within informal networks, disclosing abuse within a formal service is less common. In countries with high rates of violence against women, and attitudes that condone abuse, less than 2% of women may access formal services [<a href="#ref20" rid="ref20" class=" bibr popnode">20</a>,<a href="#ref21" rid="ref21" class=" bibr popnode">21</a>]. In contrast, a 2003 survey of women in two New Zealand regions found that 52% reported seeking help from one or more formal services, although 40% of abused women reported that no one had tried to help them [<a href="#ref22" rid="ref22" class=" bibr popnode">22</a>]. Barriers to seeking formal assistance reported by women include, for example, fear of repercussions from their partner, lack of trust, lack of confidentiality, fear of their children being removed, fear of deportation, potential loss of financial security (eg, if their partner is jailed), self-blame, feeling stigmatized, and the desire to not bring shame to themselves and their family [<a href="#ref19" rid="ref19" class=" bibr popnode">19</a>,<a href="#ref23" rid="ref23" class=" bibr popnode">23</a>-<a href="#ref27" rid="ref27" class=" bibr popnode">27</a>]. Some women may have disclosed abuse in the past but received a response that minimized their abuse, was judgmental (victim blaming), or gave simplistic advice to leave their partner [<a href="#ref28" rid="ref28" class=" bibr popnode">28</a>]. Barriers to effective help seeking are compounded when women experience multiple inequities. Such historical, social, cultural, structural, economic, and political contexts can result in mistrust of health institutions and racist and discriminatory responses that further entrap women [<a href="#ref29" rid="ref29" class=" bibr popnode">29</a>,<a href="#ref30" rid="ref30" class=" bibr popnode">30</a>]. Many of the root causes of violence directed against indigenous women, such as colonization resulting in historical trauma and racism, also contribute to and sustain unresponsive and potentially harmful institutional responses. This is most certainly the case for New Zealand M&#x00101;ori [<a href="#ref31" rid="ref31" class=" bibr popnode">31</a>,<a href="#ref32" rid="ref32" class=" bibr popnode">32</a>].

Women are often recruited through government services or community agencies, which requires attention to relationship building with the agency, ideally with some provision for reciprocity [<a href="#ref33" rid="ref33" class=" bibr popnode">33</a>]. Recruitment is generally advised by experts in the field to be done personally, in face-to-face, one-to-one encounters by trained, sensitive researchers who are skilled in managing unanticipated situations, and are ideally of the same culture as the women [<a href="#ref33" rid="ref33" class=" bibr popnode">33</a>].

Of note, 2 Web-based trials were excluded from the systematic review due to not meeting the criteria for being advocacy based. Across the studies, reviewers identified variations in baseline type and severity of abuse, commitment to the relationship, participant age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, all of which can influence recruitment and dropout (attrition) and, in turn, study validity.</p></div><div id="sec-a.m.a.f" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.m.a.ftitle">eHealth Trial Recruitment Best Practice</h3><p class="p p-first">Alongside the rapid growth of eHealth innovations are calls that programs be sufficiently tested.

However, one aspect of eHealth trials that has garnered insufficient attention is the Web-based recruitment process. To understand Web-based recruitment and where there may be risk of bias, preintervention information is needed about the number of people who are potential participants, those who are eligible, those who consent, and those who complete baseline measures.</p><p class="p p-last">There is generally a lack of guidance regarding how external validity can be assessed and promoted in trials that involve Web-based recruitment. Scrutiny of recruitment and preintervention dropout experience in eHealth trials will inform our understanding of eHealth effectiveness and utility, trial representativeness, and the risk of fraudulent participation [<a href="#ref40" rid="ref40" class=" bibr popnode">40</a>]. Few studies have addressed the representativeness of Web-based recruitment. In a review of 16 studies reporting dropout in Web-based interventions for psychological disorders, preintervention dropout (reported in 7 of the 16 studies) ranged from 4% to 52% [<a href="#ref41" rid="ref41" class=" bibr popnode">41</a>]. Additionally, there is minimal theory to explain how potential participants engage with Web-based recruitment and interventions [<a href="#ref35" rid="ref35" class=" bibr popnode">35</a>]. Liese and Beck [<a href="#ref42" rid="ref42" class=" bibr popnode">42</a>] identified a pathway of individual and contextual factors that activate negative beliefs about the success of an intervention that are then hypothesized to lead to dropout. This does not take into account, however, participants&#x02019; expectations of an intervention effect, nor the altruistic aim of women who experience abuse wanting to help other women [<a href="#ref41" rid="ref41" class=" bibr popnode">41</a>,<a href="#ref43" rid="ref43" class=" bibr popnode">43</a>].</p></div><div id="sec-a.m.a.g" class="sec sec-last"><h3 id="sec-a.m.a.gtitle">isafe Trial</h3><p class="p p-first-last">In this study we examined recruitment method effectiveness and early (preintervention) participant engagement for the isafe trial.

Both the IRIS and isafe studies had automated Web-based delivery of intervention, violence, and mental health assessments and retention procedures. While procedures to maximize isafe participant safety were paramount, and guided by explicit ethical principles, in this study we focused on recruitment and early participant engagement data.

While the study protocol was previously published [<a href="#ref15" rid="ref15" class=" bibr popnode">15</a>], in this paper we iterate and expand on the recruitment plan and automated registration process.

The target sample size was 340 women; we sought to enroll an average of 43 women per quarter, achieving the desired sample size over 24 months.</p><p>Recruitment was informed by several of our team principles. First, our principle to &#x0201c;be sensitive and inclusive of diversity&#x0201d; meant the program needed to reflect the diversity of women in Aotearoa New Zealand. The design and language used in isafe materials was influenced by women who participated in focus groups convened during the trial planning stage [<a href="#ref14" rid="ref14" class=" bibr popnode">14</a>]. We also learned that, despite our being advised to collect numerous contacts to maximize retention in longitudinal studies [<a href="#ref33" rid="ref33" class=" bibr popnode">33</a>], women in our focus groups resented being asked to identify more than one contact. Acknowledging inequities in Internet access, we also collaborated with Aotearoa People&#x02019;s Network, a library collective that facilitates free Internet access across diverse New Zealand settings.</p><p>Second, our recruitment was guided by our principle to &#x0201c;maintain the cultural integrity of M&#x00101;ori within the <em>matatini</em> (diversity) of <em>iwi</em> /tribal differences.&#x0201d; The research team <em>kaum&#x00101;tua</em> (respected and recognized elder) and M&#x00101;ori team members (DW, TD) informed the development of recruitment plans and details such as ads and language. They also consulted <em>kanohi ki te kanohi</em> (face-to-face) with a range of M&#x00101;ori women, <em>iwi</em>, and service organization networks and attended conferences (eg, E Tu Wh&#x00101;nau) to disseminate information about the isafe study.</p><p>Third, our principle to &#x0201c;act in a collaborative manner with our community and research partners&#x0201d; led us to consult with a range of advisors from local, regional, and national IPV service agencies (eg, SHINE, Women&#x02019;s Refuge) and departments (Ministry of Social Development, It&#x02019;s Not OK campaign). Team members provided presentations to agency staff and encouraged them to review the Web-based isafe tool using a guest password. Team members often had prior relationships with individuals within these agencies, who were supportive of the isafe resource and testing, and were willing to assist in recruitment.</p><p>The a priori recruitment plan was to initiate a dynamic stepped rollout of recruitment strategies over time, guided by recruitment data. The first phase of recruitment relied on the recent recruitment experience of the New Zealand Recovery via Internet from Depression (RID) trial. In the RID trial, short advertisements included in health education television programming (Health TV; Healthy Life Media Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) in medical waiting rooms proved an effective recruitment method. For isafe, we developed two short video ads to run on televisions in the waiting rooms of 53 primary health care practices, 4 accident and emergency centers, and 3 emergency departments across New Zealand that subscribed to Health TV. Approximately half (28) of the practices served a predominantly M&#x00101;ori population. One or the other of the 30-second ads was to run once every 20 minutes for a period of 4 weeks. Information about the study was included in Health TV newsletters, and the research team communicated with each site offering flyers and isafe referral cards for display in their waiting rooms to supplement the television ad. The primary method of recruitment for the IRIS study was community ads on craigslist [<a href="#ref11" rid="ref11" class=" bibr popnode">11</a>], which is not commonly used in New Zealand. While the team considered recruiting through social media sites such as Facebook, we were reluctant to do so due to security and confidentiality concerns. In addition to Health TV, the first phase of recruitment included plans for distribution of digital, print, and face-to-face recruitment ads. We prepared both mainstream and M&#x00101;ori-focused ads.</p><p class="p p-last">We monitored recruitment weekly, including review of Google Analytics (Google, Mountain View, CA, USA) reports and the isafe registration website. Summary data were available every 6 months in open Data Monitoring Committee reports. Recruitment methods were documented in a log and costs recorded. We budgeted NZ $17,000 for recruitment costs. This included $10,000 for production of Health TV ads and $4500 for running the ads.

While initial investigations had not identified a suitable section on the site for a research notice, we decided to trial an ad for &#x0201c;Research Study on Safety in Relationships&#x0201d; in the &#x0201c;Jobs&#x02013;Other&#x02013;volunteers&#x0201d; section. The ad included the mention &#x0201c;You will be reimbursed for your time.&#x0201d; Beginning May 21, 2013, a 4-week ad ran in five New Zealand locations. This short trial resulted in 21 participants: the opportunities phase had begun. While we expected that some might confuse the trial with a work opportunity, that was not the case. Review of our study log of phone calls (to our free phone study number) and emails identified only two queries about a work opportunity, both from men. Thereafter, at regular intervals, an additional 56 isafe ads were placed across 32 New Zealand cities, towns, and localities. We purposefully selected localities over time based on population size, proportion of M&#x00101;ori and Pacific people, high IPV rates (Recorded Crime Victim Statistics&#x02014;Victimisations data generated from Statistics New Zealand [<a href="#ref51" rid="ref51" class=" bibr popnode">51</a>]), and a large rural component.</p><p>During the opportunities phase, other recruitment efforts continued. For example, a collaboration between the isafe team and Auckland New Zealand Police resulted in a 3-month isafe recruitment drive (December to February 2014); New Zealand Police agreed to refer women to isafe during routine family violence callout follow-up visits. A second collaboration involved the Auckland Regional Community Alcohol and Drug Services, who agreed to post flyers and make isafe referrals to their clients.</p><p class="p p-last">At the conclusion of the Trade Me ad campaign, by the end of August 2014, a total of 412 women had been accrued to the isafe study, exceeding our recruitment target of 340 well within the allocated timeline (<a href="/pmc/articles/PMC5101415/figure/figure1/" target="figure" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="figure1" rid-ob="ob-figure1" co-legend-rid="lgnd_figure1"><span>Figure 1</span></a>). The recruitment rate increased from 2 women per month during the challenging period to 25 women per month during the opportunities period (May 21, 2013 to August 31, 2014).</p></div></div><div id="sec-a.m.c.c" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.m.c.ctitle">Preintervention Participant Engagement</h3><p class="p p-first"><a href="/pmc/articles/PMC5101415/figure/figure2/" target="figure" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="figure2" rid-ob="ob-figure2" co-legend-rid="lgnd_figure2"><span>Figure 2</span></a> outlines preintervention engagement based on the automated registration steps.

Based on information provided at the time of consent, we noted no important differences between enrolled and accrued women in regard to age, having one or more children in the home, reporting two or more types of violence (among the four eligibility criteria), or deprivation. Accrued women were typically young, experienced multiple types of violence, and lived in higher-deprivation neighborhoods. Among accrued women, 27% self-identified as M&#x00101;ori (14.9% of people living in New Zealand identify with M&#x00101;ori ethnicity [<a href="#ref52" rid="ref52" class=" bibr popnode">52</a>]). Women from most territorial regions in New Zealand were represented (<a href="/pmc/articles/PMC5101415/figure/figure3/" target="figure" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="figure3" rid-ob="ob-figure3" co-legend-rid="lgnd_figure3"><span>Figure 3</span></a>).</p></div><div id="sec-a.m.c.e" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.m.c.etitle">Recruitment Methods</h3><p class="p p-first">A total of 3 of every 4 women (76%) recruited to isafe identified Trade Me as their referral source (<a href="/pmc/articles/PMC5101415/table/table1/" target="table" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="table1" rid-ob="ob-table1" co-legend-rid=""><span>Table 1</span></a>). The next most common referral source was through friends and family (12.6%). We do not know how friends and family heard about isafe, whether from seeing an ad on Health TV or Trade Me, for example. Recruitment costs totaled NZ $21,056 ($4056 overspend). The cost per participant ranged from $1362 for the development and running of television ads in medical clinics, to $22 for online marketing ads (<a href="/pmc/articles/PMC5101415/table/table2/" target="table" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="table2" rid-ob="ob-table2" co-legend-rid=""><span>Table 2</span></a>). The online marketing ads were both efficient in cost and staff time. While networking direct costs were low, the required staffing resource was significant.</p><p class="p p-last">There were some notable differences in participant characteristics by referral source (<a href="/pmc/articles/PMC5101415/table/table3/" target="table" class="fig-table-link figpopup" rid-figpopup="table3" rid-ob="ob-table3" co-legend-rid=""><span>Table 3</span></a>). Women recruited through a friend or relative were more likely to self-identify as M&#x00101;ori and live in the highest-deprivation areas. Women recruited through Trade Me were more likely to have children in the home and less likely to live in the highest-deprivation areas.</p></div><div id="sec-a.m.c.f" class="sec sec-last"><h3 id="sec-a.m.c.ftitle">Online Marketing Ad Effects</h3><p class="p p-first">We examined the online marketing website (Trade Me) ad impact on accrual weekly during recruitment. Research staff attributed (matched) accrued women to a Trade Me ad based on location and date of accrual (research staff were blinded to women&#x02019;s self-report of referral source). Research staff attributed a total of 327 (13 more than what women reported) accruals to Trade Me ads. We placed 61 ads in 32 locations throughout New Zealand during the period May 2013 to August 2014. Individual locations had between 1 and 5 ads. The ads resulted in a total of 65,067 views on the marketing website. Individual ads produced between 0 and 9 participants while the ad was running.</p><p class="p p-last">The lag effect duration of ads past the publication period was estimated at 0.3 day (95% CI &#x02013;0.3 to 1.2), not significantly distinct from an absence of actual lag effect (<em>P</em>=.3). We therefore refitted the model without the lag effect, but included the number of ads previously run in the region and an indicator for school holidays, for neither of which we could account in the original Koyck model. The base recruitment rate was estimated by the model at 0.017 participant per 100,000 person-weeks (95% CI 0.011&#x02013;0.024). On average, ads increased the accrual rate by a factor of 74 while they were running (95% CI 49&#x02013;112). Running several ads over time in the same region was associated with a significant decrease of the accrual rate, by a factor of 0.71 after each ad campaign (95% CI 0.64&#x02013;0.78). School holidays were found not to be significant (<em>P</em>=.21) and were not retained in the model. There was fairly strong regional variation, with fitted regional random rate ratios ranging from 0.17 to 6.2.</p></div></div><div id="sec-a.m.d" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="sec-a.m.dtitle">Discussion</h2><p class="p p-first">The recruitment target for the Web-based isafe intervention trial for women who experience abuse was to accrue 340 women over a 24-month period. This target was achieved. On the automated study registration website, within 23 months, 4176 people visited the website, 501 women enrolled, completing the consent and validation process, and 412 (82.2%) women were accrued, having completed baseline measures. However, these simple recruitment statistics mask the challenges to and opportunities for recruitment that were experienced in the preintervention recruitment phase of the study.</p><p>The recruitment rate during the 8-month <em>challenging</em> period (2 women per month) represented an inefficient, financially wasteful period of recruitment print ads, website links, and networking. In contrast, the recruitment rate during the 16-month <em>opportunities</em> period (25 women per month) was valuable in both efficiency and cost. Job ads for volunteers in the largest available online consumer marketing and classified advertising website in New Zealand (Trade Me) were viewed over 65,000 times; 3 of every 4 participants identified the job ad as their source of referral to isafe. Staff time in managing and monitoring the advertising process was minimal. Interestingly, we estimate that if we had had administrative capacity to monitor high flows of participants into the trial, by running a blitz of ads across New Zealand every 6 weeks, we might have achieved our sample size within 6 months. Our challenges and opportunities experience is similar to that reported by Loxton et al [<a href="#ref53" rid="ref53" class=" bibr popnode">53</a>], where the average number of daily responses for recruiting young women to the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women&#x02019;s Health increased 5-fold with the introduction of targeted Facebook advertisements. The current I-DECIDE Australian trial is also using Facebook and achieving expected recruitment rates [<a href="#ref10" rid="ref10" class=" bibr popnode">10</a>].</p><p>When targeting participants within a large population, marketing websites or social media recruitment methods are advised. The decreasing effectiveness of ad campaigns as they are repeated, either through exhaustion of the recruitment population or lessened sensitivity to the ads, is a factor to bear in mind. Other recruitment considerations include holiday periods, the type of topic that is being researched, characteristics of the target group, and digital media tools that the group are most likely to use. Working with colleagues experienced in social and health marketing fields is also helpful. One of the strengths of Web-based studies is being able to recruit diverse populations. In our case, we successfully recruited women from across New Zealand; 1 in 4 women self-identified as M&#x00101;ori, and women living in high-deprivation neighborhoods were overrepresented. Of note, our preintervention data highlight the important contribution of friends and family in referring high-risk women to research, particularly for M&#x00101;ori women.</p><p class="p">The 18% isafe preintervention dropout rate from enrollment (consent, validation, and randomization) to accrual (completion of baseline measures) is just below the weighted average of 21% (range 4% to 52%) reported by Melville et al [<a href="#ref41" rid="ref41" class=" bibr popnode">41</a>] for trials of Web-based interventions for psychological disorders. Calculating preintervention dropout rate from earlier steps in the automated Web-based registration process, however, results in dropout rates of 59% (from eligibility assessment) to 20% (from consent criteria), indicating the importance of clarifying at which point dropout is being measured. Improved linkage between registration and intervention (and control) websites may reduce dropout between enrollment and accrual in future studies.</p><div id="sec-a.m.d.f" class="sec"><h3 id="sec-a.m.d.ftitle">Limitations</h3><p class="p p-first">This case study shares the experience of one trial in New Zealand. The available social media and populist platforms vary internationally and are sure to change over time. For the isafe study, while networking with community agencies was less valuable for recruitment, it was valuable in promoting referral links from the isafe program to services. Clarity of purpose for partnering with agencies and organizations will contribute to the efficiency and safety of the trial and its participants, as well as improve the overall trial quality and knowledge transfer.</p><p>In this case study, we collected significant standardized information on preintervention engagement with our Web-based study registration site. We do not know, however, the characteristics of people who visited the site, but dropped out prior to providing contact information. Nor do we know the reasons why people may have visited the site, such as for curiosity or help seeking, but disengaged.</p><p class="p p-last">In addition, the comparison of enrolled and accrued participant characteristics by referral type was based on participants&#x02019; self-report. In contrast, our online marketplace (Trade Me) analysis of effect modelling was based on research staff attributing accrued participants to an ad during weekly recruitment reviews based on participant and ad location and timing. This process underestimated the number of participants recruited through Trade Me by 13. In addition, our assignment of deprivation is based on the address provided by the study participant. This likely includes error due to variation in socioeconomic status within neighborhoods, the housing instability of women who experience violence [<a href="#ref54" rid="ref54" class=" bibr popnode">54</a>], and women electing to enter an address other than their own due to issues of privacy, safety, or mistrust.</p></div><div id="sec-a.m.d.g" class="sec sec-last"><h3 id="sec-a.m.d.gtitle">Conclusions</h3><p class="p p-first-last">Populist website recruitment methods can successfully recruit a diverse sample of participants for studies addressing sensitive topics such as violence against women. We hope our transparency in reporting preintervention participant engagement will influence others to do the same during this period of rapid growth in the number of eHealth intervention trials with automated Web-based registration. As suggested by van Gemert-Pijnen et al, &#x0201c;Now it is time to recapitulate the lessons learnt. We need a holistic approach to e-health development that is evidence-based and people-centred, that takes into account how people live within their own environments and that focuses on responding to stakeholders&#x02019; needs and improving care&#x0201d; [<a href="#ref55" rid="ref55" class=" bibr popnode">55</a>]. With sensitivity and research rigor, Web-based interventions have the potential to provide women a confidential, culturally appropriate, nonjudgmental resource to support their pursuit of safety and well-being.</p></div></div><div id="ack-a.n.a" class="tsec sec"><h2 class="head no_bottom_margin" id="ack-a.n.atitle">Acknowledgments</h2><div class="sec"><p>We thank the women who participated in this study for going on this journey with us as we seek to be better helpers and develop better resources.
