['            The social implementation of knowledge and technologies that are effective in epidemiological and observational studies is essential for solving social issues. In particular, there have been few attempts to implement clinical practices and information communication technologies that utilize data in the field. We describe the four stages of social implementation: 1) redefining social issues as solvable problems, 2) finding technological solutions to solvable problems, 3) social implementation contributing to the solutions, and 4) horizontal deployment of effective methods for solving social issues. Introducing a use case of artificial intelligence (AI) social implementation in child-abuse response conducted by our team, we discuss pitfalls and tips as a frame of reference to demonstrate data utilization as social infrastructure for solving social issues and to consider practical solutions in a logical manner.
