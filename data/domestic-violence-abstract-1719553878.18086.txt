['            Domestic violence (DV) against women in Iran is a hidden societal issue. In addition to its chronic physical, mental, industrial, and economic effects on women, children, and families, DV prevents victims from receiving mental health care. On the other hand, DV campaigns on social media have encouraged victims and society to share their stories of abuse. As a result, massive amount of data has been generated about this violence, which can be used for analysis and early detection. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze and classify Persian textual content pertinent to DV against women in social media. It also aimed to use machine learning to predict the risk of this content. After collecting 53,105 tweets and captions in the Persian language from Twitter and Instagram, between April 2020 and April 2021, 1611 tweets and captions were chosen at random and categorized using criteria compiled and approved by an expert in the field of DV. Then, using machine learning algorithms, modeling and evaluation processes were performed on the tagged data. The Na√Øve Base model, with an accuracy of 86.77% was the most accurate model among all machine learning models for predicting critical Persian content pertinent to domestic violence on social media. The obtained findings indicate that using a machine learning approach, the risk of Persian content related to DV in social media against women can be predicted.
