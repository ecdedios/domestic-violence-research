['          Background:                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed increased complaints from third parties about violent conditions through social media. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of domestic violence (DV) against women following exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic and its relevance to some related factors.    ', '          Materials and methods:                    This study was conducted from July 2020 to May 2021 on married women of Babol, Iran. Eligible women entered into the study in a multi-stage cluster random sampling method. Data collection tools included demographic and family data, questionnaire HITS (Hurt, Insult, Threaten and Scream). Relationships were estimated using the Univariate and multivariate regression models. Results: The mean age of 488 women and their spouses was 34.62 ± 9.14 and 38.74 ± 9.07, respectively. Of the total female participants, 37 (7.6%), 68 (13.9%), and 21 (4.3%) were victims of total violence, verbal abuse, and physical violence, respectively. Ninety-five women (19.5) had a history of coronavirus infection. Women who were satisfied with their income and husbands were university educated, their chances of DV were reduced by 72% (95% CI (0.09-0.85), OR = 0.28) and 67% (95% CI (0.11-0.92), OR = 0.33) respectively. Drug abuse by husbands increased the likelihood of DV by up to 4 times (OR = 4.00), and more contact with their husbands at home due to home quarantine was more than twice as likely to have DV (OR = 2.64). Conclusion: Since the level of domestic violence was lower than before the coronavirus pandemic, it seems that most Iranian women were more under the support of their husbands during the coronavirus pandemic to endure the fear and panic caused by the pandemic. Women whose husbands had a university education and sufficient income had less domestic violence.
