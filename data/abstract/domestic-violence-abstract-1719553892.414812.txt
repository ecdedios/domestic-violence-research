['            With the advent of technology, we are getting more comfortable with the use of gadgets, cameras, etc., and find Artificial Intelligence as an integral part of most of the tasks we perform throughout the day. In such a scenario, the use of cameras and vision-based sensors comes as an escape from many real-time problems and challenges. One major application of these vision-based systems is Indoor Human Activity Recognition (HAR) which serves in a variety of scenarios ranging from smart homes, elderly care, assisted living, and human behavior pattern analysis for identifying any abnormal behavior to abnormal activity recognition like falling, slipping, domestic violence, etc. The effect of HAR in real time has made the area of indoor activity recognition a more explored zone by the industrial segment to attract users with their products in multiple domains. Hence, considering these aspects of HAR, this work proposes a detailed survey on indoor HAR. Through this work, we have highlighted the recent methodologies and their performance in the field of indoor activity recognition. We have also discussed- the challenges, detailed study of approaches with real-world applications of indoor-HAR, datasets available for indoor activity, and their technical details in this work. We have proposed a taxonomy for indoor HAR and highlighted the state-of-the-art and future prospects by mentioning the research gaps and the shortcomings of recent surveys with respect to our work.
