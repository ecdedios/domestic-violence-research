['          Background:                    Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major global public health problem. Women are the principal victims of IPV, and some special populations have been particularly impacted. The Akha and Lahu women are vulnerable populations for IPV due to the modernization and changes of their culture and norms. This study aimed to understand premarriage factors related to IPV, including associated factors, influencers, patterns and impacts, in Akha and Lahu women in Thailand.    ', '          Methods:                    A qualitative method was used to gather information among Akha and Lahu women who had experienced IPV in the previous year and were fluent in Thai. Women who had experienced IPV in the previous year and lived in the border area of Thailand and Myanmar were invited to provide information. A thematic analysis was used to extract information from the participants and develop findings.    ', '          Results:                    A total of fifty-two married women were recruited into the study: 46.2% were Akha and 53.8% were Lahu. Those married Akha and Lahu women younger than 39 years found their partner through social media, had conditions before getting married, had high self-confidence, and tended to marry people from different tribes. While those aged 40 years and over met their husbands in village activities, were highly compliant with the norms of their culture, and married men from the same tribe. Three factors were detected as associated factors of IPV: cultural differences between partners from different tribes, substance use, and personality. Differences in age between partners, living in poor family economic status, and poor education were also detected as influencers of IPV. Four patterns of IPV were observed among Akha and Lahu married women: neglect, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, and physical abuse. Several patterns of the impacts were presented: children were neglected, especially in the preparation of daily food, having stress, having poor family relationships, and having children with unsuccessful lives in terms of education and getting a good job. Almost all married Akha and Lahu women had no particular expectations in their lives.    ', '          Conclusion:                    Akha and Lahu women face IPV problems with several key influences and impacts. Effective implementations are required to monitor and reduce the problem in the Akha and Lahu families, especially where the women are younger than 40 years old and married to men from different tribes.
